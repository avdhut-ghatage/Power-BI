# Power-BI
I am pleased to share that I have acquired "Microsoft Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence" certification. The Program Included 11 hours of practical learning with an end-to-end business intelligence solution, an Adventure works dashboard with AI Visuals to track KPIs (Revenue, Sales, Profit, Return) and compare regional performance, product level trends, and forecast. This was a challenging and rewarding course that helped me improve my BA skills in business process analysis, use cases, and data modeling.
